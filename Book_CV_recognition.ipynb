        "To perform OCR on books I guessed that the human eye focuses on certain parts of a front cover where there are informations. For sure, we read the title then the author or the other way around. Because of this, I thought that leveraging yolo and perform some finetuning on examples that highlights this human process could achieve some performance. When the machine is able to locate, we then want it to be able to \"read\". This is where pytesseract comes in handy! PT is a library, making the use of an OCR model the easy way. We could have done a custom one, but before jumping in, a quick POC is important. If the POC is cool enough I'll make my own OCR for the project!"
